### TaskDatelis

| First I came and completed the website and then I went to the responsive site

### Chalenges 

| In the responsive section, I put the burger menu button, but then it displays for a few seconds and sometimes it doesn't display, and I defined javascript for it to display a box when it is clicked, but it displays in 1 second and then hides again!

### NextSteps

### Conclusion
| The previous challenges were in the position section (when I fixed the position of the navbar and a container was in absolute mode, they overlapped, but I fixed it with z-index and I will try to solve the challenge I had today :)
